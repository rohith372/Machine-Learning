# Machine-Learning

This repository contains a number of machine learning projects I have worked on. 

The projects use a variety of machine learning techniques and algorithms. From simple logistic regression to neural networks, we are able to predict and classify a number of real world use cases. As machine learning techniques continue to advance and change, I too will continue to develop my skills in this field and add to this repository.
